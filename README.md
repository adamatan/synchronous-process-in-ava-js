# synchronous-process-in-ava-js

A stub repo examplifying the usage of `async-exec` in an ava test.  

## Goal
Run an external OS process within ava, and synchronously wait for its results.

## Running

Either run 

    make

To run the code within a Docker container, or:

    npm install
    npm test 

Both work on my MBP.
